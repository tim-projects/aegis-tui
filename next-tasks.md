- **Enhanced Clipboard Integration and User Feedback:** Refine clipboard functionality to include configurable clipboard tools (e.g., for Xorg/Wayland via `config.json`) and display the message "Press <Enter> to copy the OTP code to the clipboard." when an item is revealed. This message should only appear if a clipboard tool is configured.
